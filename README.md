# Who when can

Who when can â€“ service, where a team of people can easily schedule meeting, party and book a time slot.

Problem: 
It takes lots of time and messages to choose the best meeting time. Because there is never a slot which is convenient for everyone.

Solution: 
Create a simple online board where everyone can choose which day/time is convenient and how.

Simplified cases:

- A Company is choosing the best day for a picnic. Each person chooses appropriate days in a calendar and crosses out inappropriate.
- A teacher wants to schedule an online exam for the most convenient time for students. Students choose 3-hour time slots during the week.
